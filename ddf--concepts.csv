See: gapm.io/xwb171, b. Maddison Project Database and Penn World Table of the Groningen Growth and Development Centre, University of Groningen: Data before 1990, is based  mainly on GDP per capita PPP( contanst 2011 International $) data from Maddison Project database (MPD) V2018.The MPD builts on Angus Maddison's original dataset and is revised when there  is more and better information available see:gapm.io/xmpd2018, Penn World Table v9.1:gapm.io/xpwt9-1  and  Gapminder's historic estimates by Mattias Lindgren, which mainly uses Maddison data.

Beyond that point we have extended the series to 2040, with the hypothetical assumption, that all countries converge to a modest economic growth rate of 2%.

Our data refer to countries in the past as if they always had the boundaries they have today. Historic territories, such as USSR may sometimes also have estimates in out datatables, so be careful not to sum all rows into a total, as you will then double count many people.
