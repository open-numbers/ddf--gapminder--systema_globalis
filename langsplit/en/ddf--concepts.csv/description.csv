agricultural_water_withdrawal_percent_of_total,"Percentage of the total water withdrawal used in agriculture, including renewable freshwater resources as well as potential over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal of fossil groundwater, use of agricultural drainage water, desalinated water and treated wastewater. It also includes water withdrawn for irrigation purposes and for livestock watering, although depending on the country this last category sometimes is included in municipal water withdrawal. As far as the water withdrawn for irrigation is concerned, the value far exceeds the consumptive use of irrigation because of water lost in its distribution from its source to the crops. "
industrial_water_withdrawal_percent_of_total,"Percentage of the total water withdrawal used in industry, including renewable water resources as well as potential over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal of fossil groundwater and potential use of desalinated water or treated wastewater. Usually, this sector refers to self-supplied industries not connected to any distribution network. The ratio between net consumption and withdrawal is estimated at less than 5%."
municipal_water_withdrawal_percent_of_total,"Percentage of the total water withdrawal directly used by the population, including renewable freshwater resources as well as potential over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal of fossil groundwater and the potential use of desalinated water or treated wastewater. It is usually computed as the total water withdrawn by the public distribution network. It can include that part of the industries, which is connected to the municipal network. The ratio between the net consumption and the water withdrawn can vary from 5 to 15% in urban areas and from 10 to 50% in rural areas."

It does not include other categories of water use, such as for cooling of power plants, mining, recreation, navigation, fisheries, etc., which are sectors that are characterized by a very low net consumption rate."
